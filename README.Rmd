# idcurveviz

Identification/2-alternative forced choice tasks are ubiquitous in linguistics
and psychology. However, it is often not immediately clear how the identification
function is affected by different effect sizes or intercept values. This issue
is compounded when higher-order polynomial terms are added to the identification
curve. The goal of `idcurveviz` is to provide a set of easy-to-use functions
that allow users to quickly get an idea of how changing different terms
affects the identification curve.

## Installation

You can install the development version of idcurveviz like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github('tsostarics/idcurveviz')
```

## Examples

How does a given curve change with different intercept values?

```{r example}
library(idcurveviz)
# Polynomial terms given in order of appearance
# here betas corresponds to 2x^1 + .2x^2 + -.5x^3
plot_id_curve(betas = c(2, .2, -.5))
```

How does a given curve change along a continuum of intercepts?

```{r}
plot_id_curve(betas = c(2, .2, -.5),
              intercepts = seq(-3, 3, by=.2))
```


How does a curve change as a cubic effect is added?

```{r}
plot_interpolated_curves(from = c(2, 0, -5),
                         to = c(2, 0, 5),
                         nsteps = 10)
```

How good of an approximation can we get with an evenly-spaced 5 step continuum?
What if we had more steps to our continuum?

```{r}
plot_quantized_curve(betas = c(2, .2, -.1),
                     nsteps = 5) +
  add_quantized_curve(betas = c(2, .2, -.1),
                      nsteps = 7,
                      quant_color = 'purple')
```

What is the rate of change for an identification curve with a given polynomial?
Where is the point at which the rate of change is highest or lowest?


```{r}
plot_id_derivative(betas = c(2.5, -.2, -.5),
                   intercept = -.2,
                   domain = c(-4, 4))
```



Lastly, we might wonder what the identification function would look like in a
bivariate case with two continua that yield separate polynomials.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(plotly)
plot_bivariate_surface(betas1 = c(2, 0, -1),
                       betas2 = c(-2, -.1, 0),
                       show_quantized_points = TRUE)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/plotlyfig.png")
```
